# Non-free KiCad Assets

This directory contains optional non-free content (e.g., vendor-specific footprints,
licensed models, or redistributable-but-not-open assets).

The content is stored in a private Git submodule:
  https://github.com/getpwnam/m0dmf_kicad_nonfree

## How to fetch it

If you have access:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

If you do *not* have access, this directory will remain empty.
